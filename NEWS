v0.2
===========
Document a troublesome bug in latest build of roxygen2 that causes method extensions to appear missing because of unnecessary quotes in the \alias{} tag of the associated .Rd file when using the S4 naming convention for method extensions. For example:

\alias{"plot,myclass1-method"}

instead of 

\alias{plot,myclass1-method}
