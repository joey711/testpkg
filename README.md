# testpkg

This is a nice little sandbox. A simple, almost minimalist set of source code to build an R package. I am adding new things when I discover they have different behavior during build, or because I think they are useful examples of R code. I make no effort to be comprehensive. However, the package should build and load in your system. If it does not, let me know. 

Some additional details about testpkg

More concretely, `testpkg` provides:

 * Examples of necessary or strongly suggested elements of an R package.

 * Examples of using roxygen2 source for building documentation

 * Examples of S4 methods and documentation.

 * Some additional things TBD.
